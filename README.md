# NBA-MVP-Analysis-Capstone
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

Introduction:

This was my Case Study Project from The Google Data Analytics Capstone Project. 

This project analyzizes key factors that contribute to a player winning the NBA MVP (Most Valuable Player) award. The analysis explores the relationship between individual player performance (points, assists, rebounds, efficiency) and team performance (wins, win percentage, scoring) from the year 2000 to 2023. The goal is to identify the major predictors of MVP wins and understand how they correlate with team success and playoff performance.

Business Question

What are the key factors that contribute to a player winning the NBA MVP, and how do these factors correlate with team performance and standings from the Year 2000, including performance in the playoffs?
